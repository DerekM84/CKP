          <b>Yearly Calendar</b>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Our school year is based on the Chandler Unified School District
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chandler.k12.az.us/page/1298">
            {" "}
            Calendar
          </a>{" "}
          to accommodate older siblings attending "big boys &amp; girls"
          schools. We only close for one week during Fall and Spring breaks.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <strong>Class Times</strong>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We offer 3Â½ hours of fun, screen-free, hands-on learning in 2
          sessions:
          <ul>
            <li>Mornings from 8:00 am to 11:30 am</li>
            <li>
              Afternoons from 12:10 to 3:30 pm.(PM classes have reduced fees).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Summer Program</strong>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Our summer program runs throughout June and July, and offers flexible
          sign-up days. You can choose to come per day or per week.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <strong>Classes</strong>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We offer four classes based primarily on age: 2s, 3s, Pre-K, and
          Pre-K+. For the 2s and 3s classes we offer:
          <ul>
            <li>(2 days) Tuesday/Thursday </li>
            <li>(3 days) Monday/Wednesday/Friday </li>
            <li>(5 days) Monday through Friday</li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            The Pre-K and Pre-K+ classes are 5 day programs only, that is Monday
            through Friday. To attend the 2s class a child has to be at least 2
            years old and does not need to be potty trained. For all other
            classes, children must be fully potty trained.
          </div>
          <div>
            Our age cut-off is that a child must be 3 years old on or before the
            start of the school year (August 1st) to attend the 3s class, 4 for
            the Pre-K class, and 5 before December for the Pre-K+ class.
